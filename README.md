# Capstone Management System

Project initialization placeholder. Add project description, architecture decisions, and setup steps as you define the tech stack.

## Getting Started

1. Install required runtimes and tools for your chosen stack (e.g., Node.js, Python, or Java).
2. Create and activate your development environment (virtualenv, npm/yarn workspace, etc.).
3. Install dependencies once added (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
4. Add your application source under a `src/` directory and keep configuration in `config/`.
5. Use feature branches for changes; open pull requests before merging.

## Recommended Next Steps

- Define the tech stack and update this README with exact setup and run instructions.
- Add a license file and contribution guidelines.
- Configure linting/formatting (e.g., ESLint + Prettier) and CI once the stack is chosen.
- Add `.env.example` with non-secret placeholders for required environment variables.
